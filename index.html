      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        We met back in Summer 2016 when Sean had first moved to San Francisco and Mary Kate had started summer break from CSU Chico. Sean was just about to take a break from Tinder after a bunch of bad dates, and Mary Kate had just signed up on Tinder looking for a practice date to help prepare for another date she had recently been asked out on. She thought Sean was one of the least-sketchy-looking guys she'd seen on Tinder, and Sean thought she was love at first sight, calling her "Lassie" in his first DM to her. On the practice date, Sean melted Mary Kate's heart with his Midwestern manners, and she won Sean over by introducing him to a delicious local sausage restaurant. The date went well enough that Mary Kate cancelled her other date and we've been dating ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once summer was over Mary Kate went back to attend classes at CSU Chico and Sean visited every two weeks by car. We also stayed in touch via handwritten letters which was very romantic and also way less of a hassle compared to texting.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Mary Kate graduated from CSU Chico, we moved in together in San Francisco and it wasn't soon after that we got engaged. Now that the pandemic is finally ending, we're so excited to celebrate our wedding with you all!
